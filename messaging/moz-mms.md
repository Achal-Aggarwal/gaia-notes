Design doc: https://wiki.mozilla.org/WebAPI/WebMMS


Progress Bug: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=760065

Read through the progress bug, top to bottom, and learned that there _was_ an implementation that never landed because the whole design was changed in November 2012. The change was centered around a desire to roll-in MMS functionality to the existing SMS API. https://bug760065.bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=684381
